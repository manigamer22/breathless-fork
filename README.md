# breathless
This is basically breathless fixed or what others call it face.us just by the real creator ;)

## Why is this existing and not on the face.us repo?
Basically face.us is 1:1 breathless with no changes, just a rename i was working on it i didnt bother because of the name
i updated the offsets basically made it working added my credits in the readme after a few months i got removed as contributor and also the credits were removed (Creditcode/faithful) ironic i know, added his credits and said he updated all it alone.
